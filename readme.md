# Tools

Inspired by [this post](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/10/html-tools/), I've created my own take on the "static site as a public repository of simple browser-based tools".

This is powered by Hugo and the "rendered" site is hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages) and made available at: [https://tools.karlquinsland.com](https://tools.karlquinsland.com).

## How it works

## TODOs

- more/betteR  `CI` to get:
  - `hugo` w/ the right binary version made available to LLM/agents
  - `playwright` setup for HTML tool testing
  - screenshot or similar tool to automated screenshotting of docs/tools for use in `data/tools.yaml` (for landing page cards)

(really, `uv`)
